# General coding rules

- **Comments are bad** NEVER add comments to code unless absolutely necessary for complex business logic or long test functions
- **Good code doesn't require comments** Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
