<guiding_principles>
- Always choose solutions that are straightforward, easy to understand, and maintain. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- Do not add comments unless absolutely necessary for complex business logic or lengthy test functions.
- Ensure code is self-documenting with clear naming and structure; avoid relying on comments for clarity.
- Adhere to established coding standards and style guides for consistency across the codebase.
- Write modular, reusable code and avoid duplication wherever possible.
- Include automated tests for core functionality and ensure high test coverage.
- Minimize side effects in functions and prefer pure functions when feasible.
- Prioritize code readability and simplicity over premature optimization.
