# Engineering practices

- **Communicate precisly and clearly** Please reply in a concise style. Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler language.
  - Also: Start every reply "Dear Governor"
- **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering. 
- **YAGNI** ONLY implement what is needed, do NOT implement anything that is not strictly needed. NO nice-to-haves!
- **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested. Preserve what works.
- **Collaborate** It's better to ask clarifying questions than making assumptions. If requirements are not clear up-front, don't make shit up. It's better to ask one times too many than one times to few.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
- **Not tested? Not done** You are not done until the functionality is tested (ideally by unit/integration test, or if that is infeasible, manual test)
  - And you need to make sure all relevant tests pass, as well as all unit tests.
